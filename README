WHAT IS MAPPER?

Mapper is a static Network on Chip (NoC) process mapper that is based on the 
kmeans() algorithm. You can run it by simply typing:

	$: mapper <input> <output> <num clusters> <minimum distance>

Notice that you should provide an input file that has the execution trace of 
the application to be mapped. This file must have the following format:

	%origin %destin %cost

Where %origin is the origin process, %destin is the destin process and %cost is
the communication cost between the two process. Notice that, %origin, %destin 
and %cost must be integers separated by a space.

BUILDING IT

If you wish to build mapper you will first need to install GCC and GNU Make. 
After that, you can build it by typing in the projetc's root directory:

	$: make all

If you wish to clean all compilation files type:

	$: make clean
